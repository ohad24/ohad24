> Software development is lifelong learning. The learning never stops.

#### About Me
I'm a self-taught software developer from Israel, who loves the field of SW development.  
For each problem I face, simple or complex, I will have to break it down into smaller pieces, and solved the pieces one by one, according to the design, plan, and requirements. The feeling I get after solving a problem and providing the solution is the feeling of accomplishment and enlightenment. This gives me the motivation and confidence to continue learning and improving my skills.  
I also love open source tools and solutions because of the idea it is built on (anyone can do), and the community which supports it (anyone can help). Social networking with world-class developers is PRICELESS!.

#### What I Do
Mainly I do backend development, cloud DevOps and data schema design. Most of my solutions are cloud-based infrastructure and services (especially GCP) and can be in various deployment options, like VMs, Kubernetes, containers (Docker), serverless, and managed services.
I mostly enjoy coding in Python, JavaScript, and SQL.  
The Linux ecosystem is so powerful and versatile, that building on top of it is great and easy.  
My specialty is building REST APIs, bots and ETL processes, and DBs design (data perspective).

#### My Skills
Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL, Shell, HTML, CSS.  
Python packages for APIs: Flask and FastAPI.
Container: Docker, Kubernetes, and other cloud-based solutions.  
Serverless: GCP functions and OpenFaaS.
Cloud services And infrastructure: GCP and a bit of AWS.  
Database: Postgres, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, Prometheus, a bit of experience with Firebase and ElasticSearch.  
ETL and Scheduling: Apache Airflow (Python-based).  
CI/CD: Github actions.  
Source control: Git and Github.

#### What I'm Learning
Currently, I'm learning Vue.js and advanced Linux management and configuration.
