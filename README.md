I'm a self-taught software developer from Israel.  
I Love the field of SW development because each problem I face, easy or complex, I have to break it down to smaller pieces, solved them one by one according the design, plan and requirements. The feeling after solving a problem is the feeling of accomplishment and enlightenment.  
I much Love open source solutions because the idea it built on (anyone can do) and the community it's built on (anyone can help). The connection and interface to world class developers is PRICELESS!.
