## Hi, I'm [Ohad Mizrachi](https://github.com/ohad24)

### About Me
I'm a software developer from Israel.  
Open source enthusiast and cloud tech savvy.  
Mainly I do backend development, cloud devops and relational DB schema designer.   
Loving the Linux ecosystem, and main programing language of choice is Python.  
REST APIs, bots, web scrapers and ETL precesses are mostly what I love to build.  
Relational DBs data architecture and schema designing is my second love. Mongo is my goto tool to none structured data and Redis for high performance queries and data cache.

For deployment I'm using Kubernetes, Docker, and GCP infrastructure  mainly.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually entertain by my cat.
