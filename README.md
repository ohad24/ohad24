###  Hi, I'm [Ohad Mizrachi](https://github.com/ohad24)

#### About Me
I'm a self-taught software developer from Israel.  
I love the field of SW development because each problem I face, simple or complex, I will have to break it down to smaller pieces, solved the pieces one by one, according the design, plan and requirements. The feeling I get after solving a problem and providing the solution is the feeling of accomplishment and enlightenment. This gives me the motivation and confidence to continue learning and improving my skills.  
I also love open source tools and solutions because the idea it built on (anyone can do), and the community which support it (anyone can help). The connection and interface to world class developers is PRICELESS!.

Mainly I do backend development, cloud devops and data schema design. Most of my solutions are cloud based infrastructure and services (especially GCP), and can be in varies deployment options, like VMs, Kubernetes, containers (Docker), serverless and managed services.
